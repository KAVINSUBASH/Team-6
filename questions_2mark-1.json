Sets are commonly used for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries from a list.\nDictionary: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is defined using curly braces {} and each key-value pair is separated by a colon (:). Elements in a dictionary are indexed by unique keys, and each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are commonly used for efficient lookup and retrieval of values based on a specific key.",
